how is this app different from Shopstyle.it -- shopstyle searches through third party apis to find outfits based on
keywords (i.e. black jacket). It allows the user to see the price and links to buy this item. Users can also save the item
in their collection. The app is primarily used for affiliate marketing by bloggers and influencers. Unfortunately, once
the item is sold out or no longer available, it disappears from the app. This means that users can't add some of their
favourite items to lookbooks, if the items are not currently for sale. The virtual closet app fixes this issue. Users can
add their own clothes, and not search through endless search results for something that looks 'similar.' As a wearer of
mostly vintage clothing, I myself have run into problems with shopstyle and cannot use the app as the clothing I own is no
longer sold anywhere. Additionally, the virtual closet is for personal use, and does not require the user to add payment
information, tax ids or paypal link.
